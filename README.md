# Voice-Enabled-Home-Automation-System-using-AURDINO
This project presents the implementation of a voice-enabled home automation system utilizing Arduino, a Bluetooth module, and the ESP32-CAM module for security purposes.
The system allows users to control home appliances through voice commands, providing convenience and ease of use. Additionally, the integration of the ESP32-CAM module enhances security by capturing images or videos upon detecting motion.
